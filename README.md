Que.1) Functional Requirements:

1. Book borrowing and returning: The Library Information System should enable users to check out and return books effortlessly.
2. Borrowing extension: Members should have the option to extend their borrowing period if no other reservation has been made for the same book.
3. Book transaction management: The LIS should help the library staff manage daily book transactions, such as checking out and returning books.
4. Record maintenance: The LIS should provide the librarian with the capability to enter new records for new books added to the library or remove existing records for    books that have been taken off the shelves.
5. Online book searching: Non-members should be able to search and browse books online, while issuing and returning books should be restricted to members only.
6. Issuing and returning restrictions: Only valid members of the LIS should have the privilege of borrowing and returning books.
7. Web-based with HTML 5: The final product should be a web application using HTML 5.
8. Limited to institute LAN: The application should only run within the institute's LAN, reducing the risk of security breaches.
9. Book reservation: Members should be able to reserve books that are not currently available for borrowing.
10. Book renewal: Members should have the option to renew a book they have borrowed if no other reservation has been made for the same book.
11. Overdue notifications: The system should send notifications to members to remind them of due dates and any overdue books.
12. Member account management: Members should be able to manage their accounts, including updating personal information and viewing borrowing history.

Non-Functional Requirements:

1. Intuitive interface: The LIS should have a user-friendly interface for members and library staff to use.
2. High performance and scalability: The system should be designed to handle high transaction volumes and be scalable to accommodate the growth of the institute.
3. Secure data storage: Confidential information, such as passwords, should be securely stored to prevent unauthorized access.
4. Compliance with institute security measures: The LIS should comply with the security measures in place within the institute's LAN to maintain the confidentiality      and security of sensitive information.
5. Accessibility: The LIS should be available from a variety of devices and platforms.
6. Data backup and recovery: The system should have a robust data backup and recovery plan in case of any data loss.
7. User authentication: The LIS should have a secure user authentication process to ensure that only authorized users have access to the system.
8. Error handling: The system should have robust error handling capabilities to ensure that any errors are detected and addressed promptly.


Que.2)

Scope A sizable fraction of the population suffers from a hearing impairment. The suggested application satisfies the specific demands of its users. Users using this app can recognise numerous noises in their immediate surroundings using their Android devices. When it detects specific defined sounds, such as automobile horns or sirens, it monitors the environment in real time and tells the user via haptic feedback. Users of the programme are able to stay awake and secure while still remaining aware of their surroundings.

Features:

1. AI-based Sound Recognition: The app will use artificial intelligence algorithms to recognise key sound events, such as car horns and crying babies. This feature is    crucial for providing relevant and timely alerts to users.
2. Immediate Alerts: The app will provide real-time alerts for recognised sound events. This will ensure that users are aware of important sounds and can respond          promptly.
3. Logging of Sound Events: The app will keep a log of sound events of interest to the user. This feature will allow users to keep track of important sounds and          monitor their environment over time.
4. User-friendly Interface: The app will have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and use. This will ensure that users can access the app's features and    services without any difficulties.

Non-Functional Aspects:

1. High Accuracy: The sound recognition using AI should have a high level of accuracy to ensure that alerts are timely and relevant to the user.
  Privacy and Security: The app will prioritize user privacy and security by securely storing user data and avoiding any unauthorized access. Sensitive information       such as personal data and sound event logs should be protected.
2. User Accessibility: The app will be designed to be accessible and usable by people with disabilities, including those with hearing loss. This will ensure that the      app's features and services are accessible to the target population.
3. Performance and Scalability: The app will be optimized for performance and scalability. It should be able to handle high volumes of data and be scalable to            accommodate growth.
4. Battery Optimization: The app will be designed to optimize battery usage, ensuring that users can use the app for an extended period without having to recharge.
5. Integration with Other Devices: The app will be designed to integrate with other devices, such as hearing aids, for a seamless user experience. This will ensure        that the app's services are easily accessible to users and can be used in conjunction with other devices.
